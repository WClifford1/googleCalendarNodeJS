All appointments are 40 minutes long and have fixed times, starting from 9â€“9:40am, with a 5 minute break between appointments.<br>
Appointments can only be booked during weekdays between 9am and 6pm<br>
Appointments can only be made at least 24 hours in advance.<br>
Appointments cannot be double-booked.<br>
All appointments use UTC time.<br>

<br>

#### `GET http://localhost:3000/days?year=yyyy&month=mm`

<br>

#### `POST http://localhost:3000/book?year=yyyy&month=mm&day=dd&hour=hh&minute=mm`
