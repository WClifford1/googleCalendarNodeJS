## Google Calendar API Booking System

### Description:

This app is an appointment booking system that uses the Google Calendar API.<br>
Users access the API to view available timeslots and book appointments.<br>
All appointments are 40 minutes long and have fixed times, starting from 9â€“9:40am, with a 5 minute break between appointments.<br>
Appointments can only be booked during weekdays between 9am and 6pm<br>
Appointments can only be made at least 24 hours in advance.<br>
Appointments cannot be double-booked.<br>
All appointments use UTC time.<br>

#### Once the server is running:

#### GET http://localhost:3000/timeslots?year=yyyy&month=mm&day=dd

Displays all available timeslots for the day

#### POST http://localhost:3000/book?year=yyyy&month=mm&day=dd&hour=hh&minute=mm
